Final Exam

In my final exam I utilized the 2 column layout for my main index page and had 4 subpages all with navigation menu's to move from page to page. 

Concepts(10 required)-I chose the following however more may be present:

1)index.html had a simple animated drop down menu. The main tabs were functional and navigated from page to page and the drop down items were not function but listed items that could be found on each individual page. This is located in the CSS file under the multiple #menu codes  
2)A side menu was also established on the index.html main page that contained functional social media links to their respective sites (facebook, twitter and Instagram). This is located in the CSS file under the class .sidemenu codes  
3)The main index.html page contains in CSS file /*Child selector*/ for section > h2 {text-shadow: 2px 2px yellow;} and aside > h2 {text-shadow: 2px 2px yellow;} enabling the aside and section divs to contain a yellow text shadow.  
4)The main index.html page also contained in the CSS file :/*adjacent selector*/ h2 + p {color: purple; }which enabled the first paragraph immediatey following the h2 attribute to have the color purple  
5)At the bottom of the index.html mainpage I utilized the "Line-Based Named Lines" Grid for a simple info footer. This is located in the CSS file under .footerwrapper and .fbox codes    
The 4 html subpages "Foodanddrink", "childrens", "festivals" and "charity" all have the same feel with varying images and text  
6) On the subpages I created a functional nav menu in the top left hand corner of the page that allowed navigation between all 5 pages.This is located in the HTML code <ul id="nav"> at the top of the HTML file for the subpages    
7)On the 2 colum layout of the subpages I used 2 grids, the first in the "subaside" element is a display:in-line-grid. I used only rows for this grid. This is found in the CSS file .wrapper and .box codes. This displays a row only inline grid with 5 boxes containing examples of the topic found in the header  
8)the second grid in the "subsection" is a display:inline-grid (Grid auto-placement) using both rows and columns. This is located in the CSS file under .wrapper2 and .item classes. This one also contains the ninth child to switch colors between alternating grid boxes, it demonstrated 2 rows now as well as 5 columns containing boxes with examples of the topic found in the header  
9) On the "subaside" and "subsection" grid elements, I introduced a timed transitional element whereas the sizing of the grids change as they are hovered over. This again is located in the CSS file under the .box: hover { and .item: hover { code  
10)For the images nested inside of the "aside", "section", "subaside" and "subsection" divs, I chose a /*descendant selector*/ div img {border: 4px solid #8f2103;} so the img descendant of the div tag would receive a border with the hex colour #8f2103. Found in the CSS file  
11)The last concept worth noting is the use of the media screens, I chose one at a max width of 768px found at the bottom of the CSS under @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
