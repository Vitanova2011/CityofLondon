Final Exam

In my final exam I utilized the 2 column layout for my main index page and had 4 subpages all with navigation menu's to move from page to page. 

Concepts

1)index.html had a simple animated drop down menu. The main tabs were functional and navigated from page to page and the drop down items were not function but listed items that could be found on each individual page.
2)A side menu was also established on the index.html main page that contained functional social media links to their respective sites (facebook, twitter and Instagram)
3)The main index.html page also contained:
/*adjacent selector*/
h2 + p {
	color: purple; }
which enabled the first paragraph immediatey following the h2 attribute to have the color purple
4)
